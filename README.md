## Features
- Display a list of countries with:
  - Flag image
  - Country name
  - Dial code
  - Currency
- **Search bar** to filter countries dynamically:
  - Type part of a country name (e.g., "ger" â†’ Germany)
  - Search is case-insensitive
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile screens

---

## How It Works
1. The app fetches data (like country name, dial code, currency) from a local JSON file or API.
2. Each country is displayed in a card format with an image and details.
3. The **search bar** listens for input events:
   - When a user types, the app checks all country names
   - Cards that match the search term are displayed
   - Non-matching cards are hidden
